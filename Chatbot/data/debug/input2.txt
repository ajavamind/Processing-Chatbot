Here's the code for the Processing sketch:

```java
import java.util.List;

List<String> lines;

void setup() {
  size(1024, 1024);
  textAlign(LEFT, TOP);
  textSize(16);
  lines = loadStrings("data/input.txt");
}

void draw() {
  background(255);
  float y = 0;
  for (String line : lines) {
    String[] words = line.split(" ");
    String currentLine = "";
    for (String word : words) {
      if (textWidth(currentLine + " " + word) > width) {
        text(currentLine, 0, y);
        y += textAscent() + textDescent();
        currentLine = word;
      } else {
        currentLine += " " + word;
      }
    }
    text(currentLine, 0, y);
    y += textAscent() + textDescent();
    y += textAscent() + textDescent(); // add blank line
  }
}
```

Explanation:

- We start by loading the lines from the input file in the `setup()` function.
- In the `draw()` function, we first clear the background and set the text alignment and size.
- We then loop through each line and split it into words using the `split()` method.
- We initialize a `currentLine` variable to an empty string and loop through each word.
- If adding the current word to the current line would make it too long to fit on the screen, we draw the current line at the current y position and start a new line with the current word.
- Otherwise, we add the current word to the current line.
- After we've looped through all the words in the line, we draw the current line at the current y position and add a blank line by incrementing y by the text ascent and descent twice.
in the java programming language, does back single quote in a string, change how a string displays 
No, back single quote (`) does not change how a string displays in Java. It is used to represent a character literal in Java. To represent a string literal in Java, double quotes ("") are used.
